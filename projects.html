                                <span class="genres"><strong>FPS or Shooters. </strong></span>First person shooters are games all about shooting other players or NPCs<br>
                                (non-player characters) with a variety of weapons such as gun or more primitive projectile weaponry.<br>
                                They can be multiplayer or single player.
                                They can have upgrades to your weapons or powerful boosts to your character, but they are generally low on or devoid of any personalization, detailed character creation, or lasting character progress.<br>
                                There may be some simple level systems in place and prestige, or skills to choose,
                                but these don’t go very deep in pure shooters. FPS games do not usually have deep stories or complicated maps. Examples include DOOM, Rust, and the Call of Duty games.<br>

                                <span class="genres"><strong>RPG or RPGers.</strong></span>These are role playing games that involve deep and complex character creation and development over a long period of time.<br>
                                They sometimes span multiple games! You gain experience by defeating enemies, completing quests, or finishing other objectives. RPGs often have immersive environments, fully-fleshed out NPCs, voice acting, huge music scores, background music and sounds, and whole libraries of lore and back story to explore.<br>
                                Favorites include Skyrim and other The Elder Scrolls games, the Fallout series, the Zelda games, and the Final Fantasy franchise.<br>

                                <span class="genres"><strong>FPS RPGers.</strong></span>This style of gamer enjoys FPS games with RPG elements.<br>
                                They have lots of action and fighting, but they also include detailed character customization and progression, deep stories, and lots options to customize your playing experience.<br>
                                Players will choose skills, boosts, and equipment along the way. FPS RPGs can lean heavily in one direction or the other, or they can be pretty evenly split down the center.<br>
                                There’s a ton of variety in these kinds of games. Some FPS RPGs include the Mass Effect games and Bioshock.<br>

                                <span class="genres"><strong>MMORPG.</strong></span>stands for massively multiplayer online role-playing game, and it is about as epic as it sounds.<br>
                                Massive numbers of players gather in an online world to battle monsters, zombies, aliens, or whatever enemies the game throws at them.
                                They can often be played solo, but that defeats the purpose of belonging to an online world. The main appeal to MMORPGs, often shortened to MMOs, is that you can meet and play with people from all over the world.<br>
                                These games include all the RPG elements listed above, but in a world where everyone else can see and interact with your character, too.<br>
                                    Classic MMORPGs are Everquest and Ultima Online.
                                Recent MMOs include World of Warcraft and The Elder Scrolls Online.<br>
